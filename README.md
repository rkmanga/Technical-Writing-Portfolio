# Technical Writing Portfolio

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am RK!

Thanks for checking-out my technical writing portfolio.

This repo showcases a variety of technical content I have authored over the past 8 years and (hopefully) highlights skills in:

- Scoping and creating technical content.
- Developing information architecture strategies.
- Leading documentation projects.

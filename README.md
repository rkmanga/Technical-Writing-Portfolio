# Technical Writing Portfolio

👋 Hi, I am RK!

Thanks for checking-out my technical writing portfolio.

This repo showcases a variety of technical content I have authored over the past 8 years and (hopefully) highlights skills in:

- Scoping and creating technical content
- Developing information architecture strategies
- Leading documentation projects

Check-out some of my work on:

- [API Documentation](../technical-writing/01.%20API%20Documentation/README.md)
- [How-to Guide](../technical-writing/02.%20How-to%20Guide/README.md)

- onboard developers and third-party development teams onto a developer platform. 
* setup, consume, and interface with APIs

- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source project documentation.
- 📫 Reach me via [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/rkman).

The OAuth API documentation I authored and published (in my current project at Activision Blizzard), is designed to help third-party game developers use the Battle.net OAuth API to begin onboarding their games onto
the Battle.net platform.

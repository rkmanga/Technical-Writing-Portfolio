For small businesses adopting [CyberSource Essentials APIs](04. SDK Documentation/Payments_SDK.pdf), I updated documentation to align with a new API release.</br>
My section covered simple order API basics, integrating feedback from user testing sessions with application developers.
I developed content based on outlines provided by product owners, filling in details from the development teamâ€™s API specifications. My work was part of a larger payments documentation set reviewed for accuracy by internal stakeholders.

# How-to Guide

I authored and published [OAuth API documentation](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/guides/using-oauth) at Activision Blizzard to assist third-party developers in integrating games onto the Battle.net platform. I interviewed developers and product managers to source all original content and code samples, which I tested using Postman and VS Code.</br></br>
Despite an accelerated deadline, I leveraged quick reviews to ensure accuracy while respecting developersâ€™ limited availability.</br></br>
My documentation accounted for 35% of the 250+ markdown pages deployed on the developer portal.

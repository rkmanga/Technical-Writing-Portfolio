# API documentation

At [Tilia](https://www.tilia.io), I authored [API reference documents](https://www.tilia.io/docs/openapi/wallets/operation/CreateCustomWallet/) that enabled developers create customized wallet types. As the sole technical writer, I worked closely with the remote engineering team, iteratively updating the developer portal documents across multiple Scrum sprints.
The samples represent a subset of Tiliaâ€™s complete API documentation.

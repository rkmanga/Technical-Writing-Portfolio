# API documentation

[This API documentation](https://www.tilia.io/docs/openapi/wallets/operation/CreateCustomWallet/) I authored and published in my recent project at [Tilia](https://tilia.io), is designed to help game developers using the Tilia payment processing platform create custom wallet types for their users.
At Tilia I authored documentation(https://www.tilia.io/docs/openapi/wallets/operation/CreateCustomWallet/) that enabled developers create customized wallet types. As the sole technical writer, I worked closely with remote teams, iteratively updating the developer portal documents across multiple Scrum sprints.
The samples represent a subset of Tiliaâ€™s complete API documentation.
